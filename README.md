Accelerate app development effortlessly! This Flutter package offers a powerful starting template
featuring Material 3 support, seamless internationalization, easy license handling, and flexible
themes. With built-in state management and a navigation drawer for enhanced user experience,
kickstart your project and watch your app come to life with ease and finesse.

## Why this package?

Streamline your app development process effortlessly. Most apps require users to customize language,
color schemes, brightness, and agree to a license â€” repetitive development tasks you, as a developer,
shouldn't have to redo. This Flutter package simplifies this by providing a pre-built foundation.
Save time and effort, focus on what makes your app unique, while essential customization and
compliance features are seamlessly integrated and ready to use. Get ahead, efficiently.

## Features

- Splash screen: A splash screen is added to allow the initialization of the app and loading the state from
shared preferences.

  </p>

- License handling: You can add your own license to the [License] class in 
multiple languages. Currently, English, German, Hungarian and Spanish are supported. This license
shall be displayed after the splash screen, the first time the app starts up. The user has to accept 
this license, otherwise the app exits.

## Add your own splashscreen image

Add the path to your image in the flutter/assets section of the `pubspec.yaml` file, then reference the image in the build method of the `_MySplashScreenState` class in the `screen_splash.dart` file. 

## Add your own custom license

You can change the license, that shall be displayed by the app, anytime, by
opening the `eula.dart` file, and then modifying the content of the License class.
Requesting the custom license as mason input during installation is not practical, as
the size of the license is most like too big for that. 

## Add new words to the existing dictionaries

Open the `languages.dart` file. First, you need to add a key to the `AppLocale` class as static const String, then you need to use this new key in the static Maps defined for each language in the same class to add the corresponding translations. From that point on, you can reference your new word using the key you defined as static const String previously (in the following example I use "newkey" as the new key), like `AppLocale.newkey.getString(context)`.
