Accelerate app development effortlessly! This Flutter package offers a powerful starting template
featuring Material 3 support, seamless internationalization, easy license handling, and flexible
themes. With built-in state management and a navigation drawer for enhanced user experience,
kickstart your project and watch your app come to life with ease and finesse.

## Why this package?

Streamline your app development process effortlessly. Most apps require users to customize language,
color schemes, brightness, and agree to a license â€” repetitive development tasks you, as a developer,
shouldn't have to redo. This Flutter package simplifies this by providing a pre-built foundation.
Save time and effort, focus on what makes your app unique, while essential customization and
compliance features are seamlessly integrated and ready to use. Get ahead, efficiently.

## Features

- Splash screen: A splash screen is added to allow the initialization of the app and loading the state from
shared preferences.

  </p>

- License handling: You can add your own license to the [License] class in 
multiple languages. Currently, English, German, Hungarian and Spanish are supported. This license
shall be displayed after the splash screen, the first time the app starts up. The user has to accept 
this license, otherwise the app exits.

  </p>
- Shared preferences: The app supports state management using the
[shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) package
- Navigation drawer: The app has a built in navigation drawer defined in the [MyNavigationDrawer]
widget. The user can access  that can be injected into any new page you create.

- Color schemes: The app supports [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/) design with corresponding
widgets and color schemes. The [ColorSchemeDefinition] class contains predefined color schemes.
The user can change the actual color scheme by navigating to the corresponding menu provided by the
[MyNavigationDrawer] class.

- Logging: the app uses the [logger](https://pub.dev/packages/logger) package as a dependency to
give the developer means for structured logging.

## How to install the brick - Preparation

Install [Mason CLI](https://pub.dev/packages/mason_cli). It is a must have for
using Mason bricks.

```
dart pub global activate mason_cli
```

Create your new Flutter project:
```
flutter create {project_name}
```
move to project folder:
```
cd {project_name}
```
Initialize mason:
```
mason init
```
Add mason brick to your project:
```
mason add rapid_app_starter
```

At this point, you have added the brick to your project, but you did not yet
execute it. Read the next section, if you want to allow Google Firebase based
authentication, after that you can execute the brick, as it is described later
in this document.

## Authentication using Google Firebase

You can skip this section, if you don't want to allow Google based
authentication in your app.

In order to allow authentication using Google Firebase, do not forget to perform the following steps both
on the server side and on the client side. You need to follow the steps in [this tutorial](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-auth-in-flutter-apps#1),
focusing mainly on:

- Step 2. "Create and set up a Firebase project".
- Step 3.
  - "Install Firebase CLI" section,
  - "Install the FlutterFire CLI" section,
  - "Add your Firebase project to your Flutter app" section.
- Step 7.
  - "Enable Google Sign-in Provider" section,
  - "Configure sign-in button" section,
    - Make sure you copy the "Web client ID" in step 4 of the
    "Configure sign-in button" section and temporarily save it.
    You will need it in the "How to install" section of the present document.
  - Important: To enable Google sign-in for your Android apps, you must provide the SHA-1 release fingerprint for each app in the Firebase console (go to Project Settings -> Your apps section). You can get the SHA-1 fingerprint if you follow the next bullet point.
    - Use `keytool` to list the SHA1 fingerprint stored in your default keystore to be entered into
    the sign-in button configuration menu in Firebase in Step 7.
    Follow [this page for help](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth).

## How to install the brick - Execution

Make sure you performed the steps in the previous section, in case you want to
add Google Firebase based authentication to your project. If this is the case,
also make sure you have the Web client ID ready.

You are ready now to execute mason brick in your project:
```
mason make rapid_app_starter
```

## Add your own splashscreen image

Add your splash image in the assets directory. Make sure that you modify the `flutter_native_splash.yaml` file
according to the documentation available on the homepage of the [flutter_native_splash package](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_splash).

After modifying the `flutter_native_splash.yaml` file, do not forget to run the following command in the terminal in the root directory of your generated flutter app:

```
dart run flutter_native_splash:create
```

## Add your own custom license

You can change the license, that shall be displayed by the app, anytime, by
opening the `eula.dart` file, and then modifying the content of the License class.
Requesting the custom license as mason input during installation is not practical, as
the size of the license is most likely too big for that. 

## Add new words to the existing dictionaries

Open the `languages.dart` file. First, you need to add a key to the `AppLocale` class as static const String, then you need to use this new key in the static Maps defined for each language in the same class to add the corresponding translations. From that point on, you can reference your new word using the key you defined as static const String previously (in the following example I use "newkey" as the new key), like `AppLocale.newkey.getString(context)`.
